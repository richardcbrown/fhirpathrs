## Notes

json! macro can panic, should probably not be used in library code

Questionnaire.item.item -> repeater map for types
Observation.component.value.value -> type mapping

is / as should also check if the type is a sub type

Quantity equality

Quantity conversion

Equality/Equivalent for complex objects -> respect Quantity conversion?

Resource.contained -> reset path to contained resource
Bundle.entry.resource -> correct type?
